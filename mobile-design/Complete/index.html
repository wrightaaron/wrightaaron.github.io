					<h2>Mario Mario</h2>
					<p>
						Mario's occupation is plumbing, though in the original Donkey Kong games he is a carpenter. 
						Mario has also assumed several other occupations: in the Dr. Mario series of puzzle games, which debuted in 1990, Mario is portrayed as a medical physician named "Dr. Mario"; 
						in the Game Boy game Mario's Picross, Mario is an archaeologist; in Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis, Mario is the president of a profitable toy-making company. 
						Mario is an athlete in Mario sports games in games such as tennis and golf, as well as a kart racer in the Mario Kart series. In September 2017, Nintendo confirmed on their official Japanese 
						profile for the character that Mario was no longer considered a plumber, but the statement was changed in March 2018.

					<h2>Luigi Mario</h2>
					<p>
						Luigi is portrayed as the taller, younger brother of Mario, and is usually seen dressed in a green shirt, dark blue overalls, and a green hat with a green "L" insignia. 
						Although Luigi is a plumber like Mario, other facets of his personality vary from game to game; Luigi always seems nervous and timid, but is good-natured and can keep his temper better than his brother. 
						A baby version of the character named Baby Luigi debuted in Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, who is held captive by Kamek. 
						He also appeared in Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time as a playable character along with Baby Mario. He is voiced by Charles Martinet, just like his adult self. 
						Being the younger twin of Mario, Luigi is presumed to be also 24 years old.

					<h2>Princess Peach</h2>
					<p>
						Peach is the native resident princess of the Mushroom Kingdom. Within her castle are Royal Guards known as mushroom retainers. 
						Peach's first appearance is in Super Mario Bros. (1985) as a NPC, in which she was captured by Bowser and Mario had to rescue her. 
						However, the game suggests that Peach is not helpless as she is the only person capable of breaking the curse hanging over the Mushroom Kingdom. 
						In Super Mario Bros. 2, she became a playable character, uniquely able to hover.
						Mostly playable, her roles vary between damsel in distress and protagonist, like in Super Mario Run. 
						She is at the center of her own story with Princess Toadstool's Castle Run (1990). 
						Her most prominent role is in Super Princess Peach (2005) on the Nintendo DS...

					<h3>About</h3>
					<p>
						Super Mario is a platform game series created by Nintendo based on Mario. Alternatively called the Super Mario Bros. series or simply the Mario series, 
						it is the central series of the greater Mario franchise. At least one Super Mario game has been released for every major Nintendo video game console. 
						There are twenty-one similar games in the series and one cross-series game, Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, 
						which may or may not be included as part of the series (see Super Mario World games).
					</p>
					<p>
						The Super Mario games are typically set in the fictional Mushroom Kingdom with Mario as the player character. He is often joined by his brother, 
						Luigi, and occasionally by other members of the Mario cast. As a platform game, the player runs and jumps across platforms and atop enemies in themed levels. 
						The games have simple plots, typically with Mario rescuing the kidnapped Princess Peach from the primary antagonist, Bowser. The first game in the series, 
						Super Mario Bros., released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1985, established the series' core gameplay concepts and elements. 
						These include a multitude of power-ups and items that give Mario special powers such as fireball-throwing and size-changing.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Super Mario series is part of the greater Mario franchise, which includes other video game genres and media such as film, television, printed media, and merchandise. 
						More than 380 million copies of Super Mario games have been sold worldwide, making it the fourth-bestselling video game series, behind the larger Mario series, 
						the puzzle series Tetris, and first-person shooter series Call of Duty.

						<h4>The Mushroom Kingdom</h4>
						<p>
							The Mushroom Kingdom is a principality ruled by Princess Peach as head of state. In the instruction manual of Super Mario Bros. (1985), Peach debuts as the princess of the kingdom.

						<h4>Super Mario Facts</h4>
						<p>
							Footage from Super Mario Bros 3 appears in the climatic scene of appalling 1989 movie, The Wizard, about an emotionally withdrawn gaming champion. 
							As this was the first chance that US Nintendo fanatics would get to see the game, the movie effectively acted as an advert for the release.
