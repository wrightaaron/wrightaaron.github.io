						<h2>HTML</h2>
					</header>
					<p>
						HTML stands for hypertext markup language and is what we use to create our web pages. HTML uses pre-defined tags to add content to our pages.
						The basic structure of an HTML tag is the less than symbol, tag name, and the greater than symbol. The HTML tag for the article element would look like &lt;article&gt; because article is the tag name.
						we can also set some of the attributes and properties of an element in the opening HTML tag. When setting the property values of an HTML element, you add propertyName="propertyValue".
						If we wanted to give that article element a class of myArticle, we could add class="myArticle" because class is the property and myArticle is the value we are giving it.
						Not all elements have the same properties available to them so you need to make sure you are setting a property that the element actually has. A good resource for finding what properties are available to a given element is
						the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/" target="_blank">W3Schools HTML Tag Reference.</a>

						<h2>CSS</h2>
					</header>
					<p>
						CSS stands for Cascading Stylesheet. We create these stylesheets so they are available for us to use across many different pages instead of having to declare all of the styles in the HTML file every time we create one.
						Having an external stylesheet makes it easy to just link to that stylesheet from any of our pages to use those same styles over and over. This helps keep the look and feel of our sites consistent.
					</p>
					<p>
						We use CSS when we want to change the way our HTML elements look. When the reason you need something to look a certain way is purely for the visual effect, you would use CSS.
						You should also never use an HTML element just because of the way it looks because that can cause confusion for those with visual impairments that might be using a screen reader.
						For example: you should not use the h2 element because you like the bold look and larger font size. If that is the only reason for using that element, then you should use a different element and style it using CSS.
						Setting things like colors, sizes, etc. should be done using CSS. It exists to separate structure from design.<br>
						The <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/" target="_blank">W3Schools CSS Reference</a> is a good resource as you work through learning about CSS.

						<h2>Javascript</h2>
					</header>
					<p>
						Javascript is a client-side web programming language. The code that is written executes on the device that is viewing the web page. Javascript is an Object <strong>Based</strong> language and not Object Oriented.
						Similarly to using an external stylesheet, javascript is typically written in an external file. This allows functions and code to be reused throughout many pages on a website. 
						It also helps separate the presentation of the pages from the logic and event handling that is being used to make our pages more dynamic.
						If something happens or needs to happen on our pages, we know to go look at the javascript and add the functionality there.
